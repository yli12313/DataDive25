## Project Description

JobsLens AI addresses the critical challenge of understanding digital and AI labor market dynamics in an era of rapid technological disruption. With over 1.2 billion youth entering the labor force by 2030 in developing countries, understanding where digital opportunities exist and where skills gaps persist is essential for inclusive economic growth.

Our solution provides:

1. **Real-time Demand & Supply Mapping**: Interactive visualizations showing digital/AI job demand vs. available talent across countries and regions
2. **Skills Gap Analysis**: Identification of mismatches between required skills and workforce capabilities
3. **Industry-specific Insights**: Sector-by-sector breakdown of ICT manufacturing, ICT services, and AI-related employment trends
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Trend analysis to help countries anticipate future digital opportunities and prepare their workforce accordingly

### Key Features

- Multi-dimensional filtering (country, region, industry, skill type, time period)
- Supply-demand ratio calculations and visualizations
- Geographic heat maps showing digital job concentration
- Skills taxonomy mapping to identify training priorities
- Comparative analysis tools for benchmarking across countries

## Methodology

### Data Integration
- Consolidation of data from World Bank Global Labor Database (JOIN), and Stanford's HAI (https://hai.stanford.edu/assets/files/hai_ai_index_report_2025.pdf)
- Harmonization of country codes, industry classifications, and time periods
- Creation of unified demand and supply metrics

### Technical Implementation
- Python-based data processing and analysis
- Interactive dashboard built with modern web technologies
- Responsive visualizations for accessibility across devices

## Expected Impact
